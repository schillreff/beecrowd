# Write an program to read two scores of a student. Calculate and print the
# semester average. The program must accept only valid scores (a score must
# fit in the range [0.10]). Each score must be validated separately.

# The program must print a message "novo calculo (1-sim 2-nao)" that means
# "new calculate (1-yes 2-no)". After, the input will be (1 or 2). 1 means
#  new calculation, 2 means that the execution must be finished.

# Input
# The input file contains several positive or negative floating-point (double)
#  valuesâ€‹. After the input of 2 valid scores, an integer number X will be read. Your program must stop when X = 2.

# Output
# If an invalid score is read, must be printed the message "nota invalida".
# When two valid scores are read, the message "media = " must be printed
# folowed by the average between these 2 scores. The message "novo calculo
# (1-sim 2-nao)" must be printed after reading X. This message should be
# displayed again if the standard input number for X is less than 1 or greater than 2, as example below.

# The output average must be printed with 2 digits after the decimal point.

# Input Sample	Output Sample
